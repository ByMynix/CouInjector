MadInjector will be an open source project from 11.09.2021 and no longer close source and free for everyone to see. 
Please note that there is a file structure and it is not a single, let alone a Visual Studio project. The project is driven by a setup file. 
Here I will publish the project folder of the Injector and the main MadInjector project folder. 
So the releases [previously closed source on various cheating sites] will not be released obfuscated from now on.
