CouInjector (formerly MadInjector) is an open-source project since 11.09.2021 and no longer closed-source. From the 29.05.2022 it's a real Git project, as the previous versions consisted of a file structure and I was too lazy to make the effort.




# Compile
In this project "CouInjector" resources were embedded, among others from MamboInjector (repository to come) and a console application (repository to come) that takes care of an auto-update. These resources can of course be replaced by compiling the 2 applications mentioned and then embedding them as resources. 

Compile it in Release / x86









# Previous versions
Please note that up to version 1.9 there is a file structure and it is not a single, let alone a Visual Studio project. From version 2.0 onwards, it is only one Visual Studio project.
