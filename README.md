CouInjector (formerly MadInjector) is an open-source project since 11.09.2021 and no longer closed-source. From the 29.05.2022 it's a real Git project, as the previous versions consisted of a file structure and I was too lazy to make the effort.




# Compile
In this project "CouInjector" resources were embedded, among others, the resource "Injection", i.e. the injection file (branch in preparation) and the resource "Updater", a console application as auto-updater [Click here](https://github.com/ByMynix/CouInjector/tree/CouInjector-Auto-Updater), which takes care of automatic updates. These two resources can of course be replaced by compiling the two applications mentioned and then embedding them as resources. 

Compile it in Release / x86









# Previous versions
Please note that up to version 1.9 there is a file structure and it is not a single, let alone a Visual Studio project. From version 2.0 onwards, it is only one Visual Studio project.
